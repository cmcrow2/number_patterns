# python_primes

This program graphs all the primes in a given range. 

## Install Needed Dependencies

You should only need matplotlib.<br>
`python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib`<br>

## Run the Program

You can edit line 14 of `mpl_primes.py` and change the number to however small or big you want. This number determines how many numbers the algorithm will check. I.e. if the number is 100 then the program will plot all the prime numbers from 1 to 100

Open you terminal and run the command `python3 mpl_primes.py`.

## Install Needed Dependencies

You should only need matplotlib.<br>
`python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib`<br>

## Run the Program

You can edit <strong>[line 24]</strong> of `index.py` and change the number to however small or big you want. This number determines how many numbers the algorithm will check, i.e. if the number is 100 then the program will plot all the relevant numbers from 1 to 100.

```python
n = 25000
```

Open your terminal and run the command `python3 index.py`.
You will see this prompt:

```plaintext
Which pattern do you want to see?

        [1] : Primes

Enter the number that corresponds to
the program you wish to run: |
```

Enter the number for the program you want to run and hit enter.

You should now see the result!
